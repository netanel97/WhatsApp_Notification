## Introduction

Have you ever experienced the frustration of receiving a crucial WhatsApp message, only to have it deleted by the sender before you could read it properly? The WhatsApp Message Notification App is here to solve that problem. This application runs in the background, capturing and storing WhatsApp messages locally on your device, even if they are deleted by the sender.

## Key Features

- **WhatsApp Message Capture**: The app monitors incoming WhatsApp messages and captures their contents.

- **Deleted Message Recovery**: If the sender deletes a message, the app retains a copy of the deleted message, ensuring you never miss important information.

- **Notification Alerts**: You'll receive real-time notifications when new WhatsApp messages are received and stored by the app.

- **Message History**: Access a history of captured messages within the app's user interface.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The app is designed with a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy to use for all users.



## How It Works

The WhatsApp Message Notification App works by utilizing the accessibility services on your device to monitor incoming WhatsApp messages. When a new message arrives, the app captures its content and stores it locally on your device. If the sender decides to delete the message from their end, the app retains a copy of the message in its database.

Please note that the app respects your privacy, and the captured messages are only stored locally on your device. The app does not access or send any of your personal information or messages to external servers.

## Usage

1. Launch the WhatsApp Message Notification App on your device.
2. Grant the necessary accessibility permissions when prompted.
3. The app will run in the background, monitoring incoming WhatsApp messages.
4. Whenever a new message is received, the app will generate a notification, and the message content will be stored within the app.
5. If the sender deletes a message, you can still access and read it within the app's user interface.
